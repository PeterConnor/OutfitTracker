 **Questions**
 
 What's going on in the @IBAction func choosePhoto closures? I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around closures & completion handlers.
 
 what's happening in the singleton?
 
 how to learn w/o youtube & tutorials?
 
 whats happening inside searchbar func
 
 how to test/maximize performance?
 
 better way to commit rather thana branching.
 
 What happens when I update xcode?
 
 **Notes**
 
make collectionview look nice w/o pics loaded
 
Add instructions to support page.

button text doesnt load on simulator when u edit
 
add "-" when no text...if text = nil, text = - in save
 
 hide photopicker buttons when camera is unavail. add big library image (or grey it out?)
 
 white frame around detail pic?
 
 maybe make background of collectionview white since grey is used for label background?
