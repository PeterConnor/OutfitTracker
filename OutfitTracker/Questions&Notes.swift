 **Questions**
 
What's going on in the @IBAction func choosePhoto closures? I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around closures & completion handlers.
 
what's happening in the singleton...static?
 
how to test/maximize performance?
 
better way to commit rather thana branching.
 
xcode 9/ios 11
 
why didn't date sorting work until i deleted the app and simulated again on phone?

Need to test on device
remove the code that sets these test devices (viewcontroller - request.testDevices) before you release your app
 
ask suraya about camera bug (Should I submit with system icon, even though it doesnt look right on my device?)
ask about sorting
ask about cleaning git
ask why outfit tracker-2 affects my project (deleted outfittracker2 from downloads and this stopped working. Also, OT2 is in Source Control Navigator.
ask why are 5s simulator group rows diff sizes
