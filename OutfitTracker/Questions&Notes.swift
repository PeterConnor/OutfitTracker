 **Questions**
 
What's going on in the @IBAction func choosePhoto closures? I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around closures & completion handlers.
 
what's happening in the singleton...static?
 
how to test/maximize performance?
 
better way to commit rather thana branching.
 
xcode 9/ios 11
 
why didn't date sorting work until i deleted the app and simulated again on phone?
 
**Notes**
 
center notififaction repeat button. fix look.
 
Code review - suraya
 
add iAd
 
 change where notification request happens (not in appdelegate). deal with all situations.
 
 Change repeat to on.
