 **Questions**
 
 What's going on in the @IBAction func choosePhoto closures? I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around closures & completion handlers.
 
 how to persist data? CoreData?
 
 Why does picture get cut off?
 
 difference between indexpath and indexpath.row
 
 what's happening in the singleton?
 
 **Notes**
 
 add alerts to delete cell and maybe x button.
