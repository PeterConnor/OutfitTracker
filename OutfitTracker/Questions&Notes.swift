 **Questions**
 
What's going on in the @IBAction func choosePhoto closures? I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around closures & completion handlers.
 
what's happening in the singleton...static?
 
how to test/maximize performance?
 
better way to commit rather thana branching.
 
xcode 9/ios 11
 
why didn't date sorting work until i deleted the app and simulated again on phone?
 
**Notes**
 
add banner - https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/banner

Need to test on device
remove the code that sets these test devices (viewcontroller - request.testDevices) before you release your app
 
noteworthy labels get cut off on bottom
need to add banner logic/properly test
ask suraya about camera bug
