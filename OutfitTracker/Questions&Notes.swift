 **Questions**
 
 What's going on in the @IBAction func choosePhoto closures? I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around closures & completion handlers.
 
 what's happening in the singleton?
 
 how to learn w/o youtube & tutorials?
 
 whats happening inside searchbar func
 
 how to text/maximize performance?
 
 better way to commit rather thana branching.
 
 **Notes**
 
make collectionview look nice w/o pics loaded
 
Add instructions to support page.

allow user to delete & take new photo in detail view (allow editing for date, note, group. See WJ app for date - picker view).
